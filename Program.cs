    Hey there ! Welcome to this little simple meme I put together, 
    For now, most of this code is uncommented and soon will be commented

    To build and run this use

    `dotnet restore`
    `dotnet run`

    or if you want a built version:
    `dotnet build` (you can also output to a different folder)
    `dotnet {path_to_built_file_here}`
