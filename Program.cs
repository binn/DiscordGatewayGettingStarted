    Hey there ! Welcome to this little simple meme I put together, 
    For now, most of this code is uncommented and soon will be commented

    To build and run this use

    `dotnet restore`
    `dotnet run`

    or if you want a built version:
    `dotnet build` (you can also output to a different folder)
    `dotnet {path_to_built_file_here}`

    If you'd like for me to throw this into a class library and just react with a thumbsup on Issue #2 on the repository

    This program uses the following NuGet packages:
        * Newtonsoft.Json - For Serialisation of JSON in/out.
        * Websocket4Net - For connecting to the Gateway.

    This program is compatible with .NET Core 2.0 (is designed around it).

    The purpose of this program is to get connected with the gateway, and do very basic processing.
